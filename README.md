# PyBingX

A Python client for the BingX cryptocurrency exchange API. This package allows developers to seamlessly interact with the BingX API to fetch market data, manage trades, and perform other account operations.

## Features

- Fetch market contract details
- Get order book depth information
- Retrieve recent trades
- Fetch historical klines (candlestick data)
- Easy-to-use and extend
- Built-in HMAC signature generation for secure API requests

## Installation

To install `pybingx`, first clone the repository and install it locally:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Getting Started

### Importing the Client

```python
from pybingx import BingXClient
```

### Example Usage

```python
from pybingx import BingXClient

api_key = "your_api_key"
secret_key = "your_secret_key"

client = BingXClient(api_key, secret_key)

# Fetch contract details
contracts = client.get_contracts()
print("Contracts:", contracts)

# Fetch depth information
depth_info = client.get_depth("SHIB-USDT", limit=5)
print("Depth Info:", depth_info)

# Fetch recent trades
trades_info = client.get_trades("BTC-USDT", limit=10)
print("Recent Trades:", trades_info)

# Fetch premium index
premium_index = client.get_premium_index("BTC-USDT")
print("Premium Index:", premium_index)

# Fetch funding rate history with time range
start_time = 1672531200000  # Example timestamp in milliseconds
end_time = 1672617600000    # Example timestamp in milliseconds
funding_rate_history = client.get_funding_rate_history("BTC-USDT", start_time=start_time, end_time=end_time, limit=5)
print("Funding Rate History:", funding_rate_history)

# Fetch historical klines (candlestick data)
klines = client.get_klines("BTC-USDT", interval="1h", limit=1000, start_time=1672531200000)
print("Klines:", klines)

```

## Project Structure

### File Descriptions

- `client.py`: Contains the `BingXClient` class responsible for making API requests.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for signing requests and handling query parameters.
- `setup.py`: Package setup file for project installation.

## Available Methods

### `get_contracts()`
Retrieve contract details for available trading pairs.

### `get_depth(symbol: str, limit: int)`
Fetch order book depth information for the specified trading pair.

### `get_trades(symbol: str, limit: int)`
Retrieve the most recent trades for a given trading pair.

### `get_premium_index(symbol: str)`
Fetch the premium index for a specific trading pair.

### `get_funding_rate_history(symbol: str, start_time: int, end_time: int, limit: int)`
Retrieve the funding rate history for a specific trading pair within a time range.

- If both `start_time` and `end_time` are not sent, the API returns the latest data within the `limit`.
- The returned list is sorted by time from smallest to largest.
- If the amount of data between `start_time` and `end_time` exceeds the `limit`, the API returns the data from `start_time` up to the `limit`.

### `get_klines(symbol: str, interval: str, limit: int, start_time: int)`
Fetch historical klines (candlestick data) for a specific trading pair.

    symbol: The trading pair symbol (e.g., "BTC-USDT").

    interval: The interval of the klines (e.g., "1h", "4h", "1d").

    limit: The maximum number of klines to retrieve (default is 1000).

    start_time: The start time for the klines in milliseconds (optional).
